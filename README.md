> This repository contains my own macOS configuration. The scripts are not written to work for everybody, due to some absolute paths, but you can take inspiration to see how I work or reuse some of the bash functions and snippets.

## About The Project

This repository includes greatly customized [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) with [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) featuring auto-completion, [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting), [autopair](https://github.com/hlissner/zsh-autopair) and a [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. Also, a one-liner install leverages Brew and mackup to setup an entire macOS environment.

### Directory structure

* `config` contains the configurations files, e.g. for **zsh** and **git**.
  * Other configurations files are backed up via [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)

* `scripts` contains my common used shell scripts.
  * My workflow uses the self-written `fzf-script-launcher` function to quickly call every binary inside the *scripts* folder (except the scripts inside *_templates* and *setup* folders).
  * Keybinding of the shell widget for the `fzf-script-launcher` function is Ctrl + X
  * Scripts are all linted using [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
  * Warning: **Do not just run any script blindly, check what they do first.**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

2: Clone the repository

```sh
# Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your actual username
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/dotfiles.git
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Inside the `scripts/setup` folder I have some scripts to quickly setup my entire dev environment with all necessary software and configurations from a fresh macOS installation. There are four basic setup scripts:

* `init.sh` - installs macOS software updates, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* `brew.sh` - installs [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) and [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/), [brew cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/), **npm** and **ruby** packages
* `macos.sh` - setting configurations for macOS applications like *Preferences*, *Dock*, *Finder*, *Mail*, *SystemUIServer*, etc.
* `config.sh` - setting configurations for remaining applications

One-liner to setup everything. This will run all four scripts.

```bash
./setup.sh all
```

To exclude the execution of one script, exclude it from the arguments.

```bash
# e.g. to just install software - run only init and brew
./setup.sh init brew
```

## Manual Changes

* Deactivate automatic screen brightness for the retina display
* Never deactivate monitor if plugged in
* Requiring password immediately after sleep begins (defaults write does not work since macOS 10.13.4)
* Finder: remove (recently used, iCloud, tags, cds, bonjour-computer) from the sidebar

## Work Related Manual Changes

* Add work signature to mail
